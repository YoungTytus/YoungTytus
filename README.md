👋 Hi, I’m @YoungTytus
❤ Python is my second love
🌱 I’m currently learning Django.

Programming is my passion and I see myself doing this in the future.
My favorite language is Python and it is the reason why I started loving
programming again. I don’t have experience with commercial programming,
but I’m a fast learner and I am very determined, which will help me get
to the top.
