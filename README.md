👋 Hi, I’m @YoungTytus
❤ Python is my second love
🌱 I’m currently learning OpenCV.

Programming is my passion and I see myself doing this in the future. My favorite language is Python and it is the reason why I started loving programming again. I am a fast learner with determination when it comes to solving problems.
